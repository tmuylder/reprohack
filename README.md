# ReproHack
*A collaborative effort on reproducible data analysis*

----

## 1. Introduction
Many scientific papers out there have insufficient documentation of its methods and data-analyses resulting in poorly understandable science or irreproducible outcomes. The ReproHack movement aims to address this issue by raising awareness on the importance of Open Science and encouraging papers to be published with reproducible coda and accessible data.


With this consent we'll gather on **date** for the first ReproHack!

## 2. What is ReproHack
During a ReproHack, participants attempt to reproduce published research of their choice from a list of proposed papers with publicly available associated code and data. Participants get to work with other people’s material in a low pressure environment and record their experiences on a number of key aspects, including reproducibility, transparency and reusability of materials. At the end of the day we regroup, share our experiences and give feedback to the authors.

We want to create a low-pressure environment to actually get working with other people's code and data. Each group will tackle a paper with published code and attempt to emulate the data-analysis part.  
Ultimately, this provides an opportunity to test how reproducible papers are 'out of the box', enabling evaluation of how successful current practices are, and identifying strengths and weaknesses.



*Disclaimer: It’s imperative to note that ReproHacks are by no means an attempt to criticise or discredit work. We see reproduction as beneficial scientific activity in itself, with useful outcomes for authors and valuable learning experiences for the participants and the research community as a whole.*

## 3. Participate
Participations are free of charge and we encourage everyone with some experience in bioinformatics and data analysis to register for this hackaton.

1. Nominate a paper

We invite nominations from anyone. Both researchers that have submitted a paper and would like to test whether one of their own papers is reproducible, and researchers that want to dig into the code of another paper! Either way, we encourage proponents to seek consent from the original authors for their nominations. Nominate a paper by opening a new issue on this Github page [this link](google.be)

2. Register as participant

Join us at the hackaton and register [here](google.be).

## 4. Feedback
We encourage to fill in a feedback form on the paper that you picked after the hackaton.

We want to emphasize that we appreciate all authors who have nominated their papers for the hackathon, and so we expect that any feedback and criticism on authors’ work is expressed in a constructive, friendly and respectful manner.


## 5. On the day

### 5.1 First things first

**Code of conduct:** As all ReproHack events, we strive to make this event open and inclusive to all. As such the event is governed by the [ReproHack Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

**Authors:** We encourage authors to be available for participants to reach out to for guidance or even just to say hello!

**Participants:**
1. Project review and team formation
We’ll start with a brief review of the papers proposed and then form into teams. Feel free to work on your own if you prefer but we highly recommend you discuss your experiences with fellow participants as you work.

2. Select and register a paper
  - Each paper will have a [hackpad](https://hackmd.io/) enabling recording the outcomes
  - Add your details in the participants section of the hackpad so we have a complete list of participants.
  - Register your team and paper by logging the title of the selected paper and the name(s) of the reviewer(s) in the hackpad. You can use the following template:

**Paper:** *Title of the paper*
**Reviewers:** *Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, etc.*  

```
**Paper:** *Title of the paper reproduced*
**Reviewers:** *Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2 etc.*
```

**Work on the paper:**
Follow any instructions/documentation associated with the papers and try and reproduce the work. As you work through your paper, keep in mind the main points on which feedback to the authors will be provided are Findability, Accessibility, Reproducibility, Documentation and Reusability. It might help to have a look at the feedback form before you begin and keep notes during. Feel free to use the event hackpad to record general findings you wish to share with the group.

We’ll come together during the day to discuss progress and troubleshoot any sticking points.

Should you finish reproducing your paper quickly, feel free to explore the work more deeply. For example, you could try and run additional analyses, create new plots or even combine materials with your own or other open materials available on the web!

You might want to consider attempting to replicate the results, for example, if the code is in R consider translating the analysis to python and examining whether you are getting the same results. Such a contribution would be appropriate for publication in the ReScience C journal! Have a look at the journals website for further details.

Should you produce any additional materials relating to your reproduction during the session, we ask that you share it publicly and add any links to such materials to the hackpad.

4. Leave feedback for the authors
Please complete the [feedback form](google.be). Please also remember to be respectful and constructive. Here’s an example of feedback to authors.  
Take notes for yourself.

This hackaton is based on the work of the ReproHack movement in the Netherlands which you can find at https://github.com/reprohack. In favor of a more Life Sciences related edition, this material was slightly adapted.
